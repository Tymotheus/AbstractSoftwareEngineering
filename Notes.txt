The Main Differences Between an Expression and a Statement in Programming

Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.
Statements create side effects to be useful, while expressions are values or execute to values.
Expressions are unique in meaning, while statements are two-sided in execution. For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not.
Statements are the whole structure, while expressions are the building blocks. For example, a line or a block of code is a statement.


1st lab notes for Eclipse Modelling Framework:
- function call class can inherit after statement
- refering to v1 of Metaclass Diagram, replace lines with statements
- line numbers are redundant: any class can come with ordered property


Keep it simpler!
Make statements consist only of strings!
